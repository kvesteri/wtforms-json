WTForms-JSON
============

WTForms-JSON is a `WTForms`_ extension for JSON data handling.

.. _WTForms: https://wtforms.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

What does it do?
----------------

- Adds support for booleans (WTForms doesn't know how to handle `False` boolean
  values)

- Adds support for ``None`` type :class:`~wtforms.fields.FormField` values

- Adds support for ``None`` type :class:`~wtforms.fields.Field` values

- Support for patch data requests with :attr:`patch_data`
  :class:`~wtforms.form.Form` property

- Function for converting JSON data into dict that WTForms understands
  (:func:`flatten_json` function)


Quickstart
----------

In order to start using WTForms-JSON, you need to first initialize the
extension. This monkey patches some classes and methods within WTForms and adds
JSON handling support::

    import wtforms_json

    wtforms_json.init()


First Example
-------------

After the extension has been initialized we can create an ordinary WTForms form.
Notice how we are initalizing the form using :meth:`from_json` class  method::


    from wtforms import Form
    from wtforms.fields import BooleanField, TextField


    class LocationForm(Form):
        name = TextField()
        address = TextField()


    class EventForm(Form):
        name = TextField()
        is_public = BooleanField()


    json = {
        'name': 'First Event',
        'location': {'name': 'some location'},
    }

    form = EventForm.from_json(json)


Here :meth:`from_json` takes exactly the same parameters as
:meth:`Form.__init__ <wtforms.form.Form.__init__>`.


If you want WTForms-JSON to throw errors when unknown json keys are encountered
just pass ``skip_unknown_keys=False`` to :meth:`from_json`::

    json = {
        'some_unknown_key': 'some_value'
    }

    # Throws exception
    form = EventForm.from_json(json, skip_unknown_keys=False)



Using patch_data
----------------

The way forms usually work on websites is that they post all the data within
their fields. When working with APIs and JSON data it makes sense to not
actually post all the data that hasn't changed -- rather make so called patch
request which only post the data that the user actually changed.

You can get access to the patch data (data that only contains the actually set
fields or fields that have defaults and are required) with form's
:attr:`patch_data` property.

Now lets use the forms from the previous example::


    >>> form.data
    {
        'name': 'First Event',
        'is_public': False,
        'location': {
            'name': 'some location',
            'address': None
        }
    }
    >>> form.patch_data
    {
        'name': 'First Event',
        'location': {
            'name': 'some location'
        }
    }


Internals
---------

WTForm uses special flattened dict as a data parameter for forms. WTForms-JSON
provides a method for converting JSON into this format.

Note this is done automatically internally::


    from wtforms import Form
    from wtforms.fields import FormField, StringField
    from wtforms_json import flatten_json


    class FormB(Form):
        b = TextField('B')

    class FormA(Form):
        a = FormField(FormB)


    assert flatten_json({'a': {'b': 'c'}}) == {'a-b': 'c'}


This neat little function understands nested lists and dicts as well::


    from wtforms_json import flatten_json


    class FormC(Form):
        c = IntegerField('C')


    class FormB(Form):
        b = FormField(FormC)

    class FormA(Form):
        a = FieldList(FormField(FormB))


    deep_dict = {
        'a': [{'b': {'c': 1}}]
    }

    assert flatten_json(deep_dict) == {'a-0-b-c': 1}
